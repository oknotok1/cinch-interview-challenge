        "No one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.",

        "Pork Chops works really well with Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Riesling. Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. You could try Goldeneye Gowan Creek Vineyard Pinot Noir. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 80 dollars per bottle.",

On the palate, it is deep and lush, with layers of wild blackberry and plum pie supported by a streak of acidity that adds definition to the flavors, while drawing the wine to a lingering finish with hints of lavender, pennyroyal, and Asian spices.",

(If you can't find this in a store, order this online and get his whole stash! I use them all, and you won't want to miss the fireworks of flavors that explode in you mouth every time you season your meals.)Heat a skillet on the stove over medium heat and add the Olive Oil.3. Next get three bowls or plates and place flour on one, mix your two eggs together in the second, and in the third place your Italian bread crumbs. Take your seasoned pork chops and dip them in the flour, then the egg, and finally coat really well in the Italian bread crumbs.Lightly brown the pork chops on both sides, between 2-5 minutes in the skillet. Adter they are browned, remove from the skillet and place in a 9\" x 13\" baking dish. Place these in the oven covered with foil for 1 hour.After the hour, remove the dish from the oven and remove the foil. In a separate bowl mix together the milk, dales, and cream of potato soup. Once mixed well, place this mixture on and around the pork chops, cover again with foil, and place back in the over for an additional 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, remove from oven, remove foil, and allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving. Perfect with a side of homestyle potatoes, french bread, and salad!",

        "Salad works really well with Chardonnay, Alcoholic Drink, and White Wine. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. One wine you could try is Game of Thrones Chardonnay. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 20 dollars.",
